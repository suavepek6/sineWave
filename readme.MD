ABOUT:
	
	The 'Audio-file Analysis' executable is a simple Python program that provides various visual representations (graphs) of any audio file that you select. 
	
	We (AudioPeopleTM) have designed this simple program for audiophiles, who want to analyze sound as soon as possible. Most programs that are popular nowadays are either on the command-line (very fast but not suitable for the not-so-tech literate) or have an extensive GUI that overwhelms even the most experienced audiolovers out there. This executable has a small, easy-to-grasp GUI. It also has good feedback when it comes to generating graphs.

FEATURES:
	
	- Can graph out various aspects of your audio file
		- Waveform
		- Spectrogram
		- Reverb graphs
		
	- Computes important values of the audio file:
		- Length of audio file
		- Low, mid and high RT20 frequencies
		- Difference in RT60 values
	
	- Cleans data of audio file by removing metadata (automatically done)
	
INSTRUCTIONS:
	
	1. Click "Upload Audiofile" and select the one you want to analyze.
	(If the file is in MP3 format, it is automatically converted to WAV.)
	(When the audiofile is uploaded, metadata is removed immediately.)
	
	2. The important values will be viewed on the left (RT60, frequency, time)
	3. Click on any of the 3 buttons on the right to see the low, medium and high frequency charts
	4. Click on the "Combine" button to see all three graphs overlapped.
